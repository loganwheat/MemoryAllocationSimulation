 * Procedures:
 *     main - functions as the driver function to choose what simulation
 *     to run. A menu is displayed showing possible options, which allows
 *     the user to insert an integer choosing his/her option. A switch statement
 *     calls the proper function.
 *
 *     fixed - simulates the process of memory allocation using fixed
 *     partitioning of 8 equal partitions of 8 MB's.
 *
 *     fixedUnequal - simulates the process of memory allocation using fixed
 *     partitioning of 8 unequal partitions of 8, 2, 4, 6, 8, 8, and 12 MB's. 
 *
 *     dynamic() - simulates the process of memory allocation using dynamic
 *     partitioning of 56 MB's.
